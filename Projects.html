    <p class="p">My first project wass for APCSP class. The assignment was to research a tech innovation from the last few years that involved data in some way. The research would then be put into a slideshow. I learned a lot about the innovation I researched called Unreal Engine 5 and why it was important in gaming and 3D modeling.</p>

    <p class="p">My second project was for English class. It was the final project for that class and we had to pick an issue we were passionate about and help solve it in some way. My group chose global poverty and we created a website which we shared around, spreading awareness and asking for donations. I learned about the situation of the global poor and why we should be working to solve it. I also used my website making skills that I got in APCSP class.</p>
